Welcome to Messaging App Frontend! This is built using React + Vite. The ChatPage component which can also be considered the homepage, contains a ChatPanel for users to chat with other users and a UsersPanel which contains a list of all users available to chat with, displaying online status.

Users can view and make customizations to their profiles (profile picture and bio) thanks to the Profile component. The UserForm component is written in such a way that it is used for both login and signup.
